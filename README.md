conti locker ransomware source code leak
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Conti Group announced its support of Russia and threatened to deploy "retaliatory measures" if cyberattacks were launched against the country. As a result, approximately 60,000 messages from internal chat logs were leaked by an anonymous person who indicated their support for Ukraine along with source code and other files used by the group.
Additionally, the Conti Locker source code was leaked, first as a password protected zip file but later it was leaked again â€” this time without any password.
The zip contents include Conti Locker v2 source code as well as the source code for the decryptor.
